I'm trying to solve all easy and medium questions in Hackerrank Algorithm domain. This repository contains my solutions to these questions. I will also add comments to explain my ideas. Hope that helps.
Now there are quite a few solutions. I will try to finish the questions as soon as possible. After all easy and medium questions solved, I will start working on the hard ones. I may also ran into some question I can't solve, but I will learn the knowledge I need and eventually solve it, instead of skipping it.
Discussions are extremely welcomed!
